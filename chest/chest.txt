serratus anterior:---------------
origin:outer surfaces and superior borders of first eight or nine ribs, and fascia covering first intercostal space
insertion:anterior surface (costal surface of the medial border of the scapula)
action:rotates scapula for avduction and flexion of arm, protracts scapula
nerve:long thoracic nerve (c5-c7)
relationshops:serratus anterior and rhomboids both insert on the medial border of scapula; they are antagonists causing protraction and retraction

teres major:----------
origin:lower third of the posterior surface of the lateral border of the scapulla, near the inferior angle
insertion:medial lip of the intertubercular (bicipital groove of the humerus
action:medially rotates arm, adducts arm, extends arm
nerve:lower subscapular nerve (c5,c6)

pectoralis major:------------
origin:clavicular part-medial half of the clavicle; sternocostal part-sternum, upper six costal cartilages, aponeurosis of external olique
insertion:lateral lip of intertubercuular (bicipital) groove of the humerus
action:both parts adduct, medially rotate arm; clavicular part flexes arm from full extension; sternocostal part extends the flexed arm
nerve:medial and lateral pectoral nerves (c5-c8, t1)

coracobrachialis:---------
origin:tip (apex) if the ciracoid process of scapula
insertion:middle third of the medial surface and border of the humerus
action:weakly adducts arm (flexion unsubstantieted), aids in stabilizing humerus
nerve:musculocutaneous nerve (c6,c7)
realationships: deep to short head of biceps

subscapularis:----------
origin:subscapular fossa on the anterior surface of scapula
insertion:lesset tuberosity (tubercle) of the humerus, ventral part of the capsule of the shoulder joint
action:medially rotates arm, stabilizes glednohumeral joint
nerve:upper and lower subscapular nerves (c5,c6)

pectoralis minor:------
origin:external surfaces if the third, fourth and fifth ribs
insertion:coracoid process of the scapula
action:draws scapula forward and downard, raises ribs in forced inspiration
nerve:medial pectoral nerve (c8,t1)
relationships:deep to pectoralis major

deltoid:------
origin:anterior position-anterior border and superior surface of the lateral third of the clavicle; middle portion-lateral border of the acromion process; posterior portion-extends and laterally rotates arm
insertion:deltoid tuberosity, on the middle of the lateral surface of the shaft of the humerus 
action:anterior portion-flexes and medially rotates arm; middle portion-abducts arm; pposterior portion-extends and laterally rotates arm
nerve:axillary nerve (c5,c6)

subclavius:----------
origin:junction of the first rib with it's costal cartilage
insertion:groove on the inferior (lower) suurface of the clavice
action:depresses clavicle, draws shoulder forward and downward, streadis clavicle duringg movements of shoulder girdle
nerve:c5,c6

sternocleidomastoid:--------------
origin:sternal head=manubrium of sternum
clavicular head-meidal part of clavicle
insertion:mastoid process of temporal bone, lateral half of superior nuchal line of occipital bone
action:one side-bends neck laterally, rotates head to opposite side
both sides together-flexes neck, draws head ventrally and elevates chin, draws sternum superiorly in deep inspiration
nerve: spinal part of accessory nerve (c2, c3)

platysma:----------------
origin:substaneous fascia of upper one-fourth of chest just below the clavicle
insertion:substaneous fascia and muscles of chin and jaw, mandible
action:depresses and draws lower lip laterally, draws up skin of chest, depresses mandible
nerve:cervical brawnch of facial nerve

intercostales externi:---------
origin: lower margin of upper eleven ribs
insertion:superior border of rib below(each muscle fiber runs obliquely and inserts toword the costal cartilage)
action:draw ventral part of ribs upward, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity for inspiration
nerve:intercostal nerves

intercostales interni:--------
origin: from the cartilages to the angles of hte upper elebem ribs
insertion:superior border of the rib below (each muscle fiber runs obliquely and inserts away from the costal cartilage)
action: draw ventral part of ribs downward, decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity for expiration
nerve:intercostal nerves

transversus thoracis:----------
origin:inner surface of lower portion of sternum and adjacent costal cartilages
insertion:inner surfaces of costal cartilages of the second through sixth ribs
draws venrtal part of ribs downward, decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity for forceful expiration
nerve:intercostal nerves
