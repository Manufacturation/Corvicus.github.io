serratus posterior inferior:
origin:spinous processes of the lower two thoracic and the upper two or three lumbar vertebrae
insertion:lower borders of bootom fourrr ribs
action:pulls ribs down, resisting pull of diaphragm
nerve:t9-t12

diaphragm:
origin:sternal part-inner part of xiphoid process; costal part-inner surfaces of lower six ribs and their cartilages; lumber part-upper two or three lumber vertebrae and lateral and medial lumbocostal arches
insertion: fibers converge and meet on a central tendon
action:draws central tendon inferiorly, for inspiration
nerve:phorenic nerve (c3-c5)
NOTE:this muscles inserts upon itself. it's action is to change the volume o  the thoracic and abdominal cavities

obliquus externus abdominis:
origin:lower eight ribs
insertion:anterior part of iliac crest.. abdominal aponeourosis to linea alba
action:compresses abdominal contents, laterlly flexes and rotates vertebral column
nerve:eight to twelfth intercostal, iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal nerves
relationships: most uperficail of the three lateral abdominal muscles (note:important in forced expiration, coughting, sneezing)

obliquus internus abdominis:
origin:lateral half of inguinal ligament, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia
insertion:cartilage of bottom three or fouur ribs, abdominal aponeurosis to linea alba
action:compresses abdominal contents, laterally flexes and rotates vertebral column
nerve: eight to twelfth intercostal, iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal nerves
relationships:middle layer of the three lateral abdominal muscles (note:important in forced expriration, coughing, sneazing)

transversus abdominis:
nerve:lateral part of inguninal ligament, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, cartilage of lower six ribs
insertion:abdominal aponeurosis to linea alba
action:compresses abdomen
nerve:seventh to twelfth intercostal, iliohypogastrical, ilioinguinal nerves
relationships deepest of the three lateral abdominal muscles

rectus abdominis:
origin:crest of pubi, pubic symphysis
insertion:cartilage of fifth, sixth, and seventh ribs, xiphoid  process
actions: flexes vertebral column, compresses abdomen
nerve: seventh throught twelfth intercostal nerves
